# Tictac
Tictac is a time tracker that is able to provide statistics and reporting for the management. The goal is to save time on the 1 on 1 meetings and yearly assessment preparations, by structuring what was achieved during the period of time. The statistics can be helpful to quantify where you spend time. This is probably where efficiency gains would matter.
